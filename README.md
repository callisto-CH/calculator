# calculator

This is a calculator created for The Odin Project.
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

This calculator supports keyboard inputs:
= : Enter or = key
AC : Delete key
+/- (negative sign) : n key
All numbers and operators can be input with their corresponding keys.

This calculator supports numbers up to 9 digits long, including decimal points (but not negative signs). Results with a decimal point will be truncated to the 9th digit as long as that digit occurs to the right of the decimal point (e.g. a result of 1.34567895 will become 1.3456789, but 12345678.1 will not be truncated to 12345678. and will instead cause an error. Similarly, a result of 1234567890 will cause an error).

I not a professional programmer (yet) so beware, you who chooses to look at my JavaScript. I welcome suggestions on how I can clean up my code.
